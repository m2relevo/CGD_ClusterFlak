# ArmadHeroes

Welcome to the ArmadHeroes source code repository. 

## Unity Version
The Unity project has been created with Unity 5.2.1 to match the PS4 Unity version in 3Q22. We suggest this is used across the board (note that several installs of Unity can live on the same machine).

## Asset Folders
The Unity Assets folder has been split into teams, with an additional **_Integration** folder. The intention is that each team will keep their assets local to their own asset folder for 'incubation'. As different aspects of the code matures and cross-cutting aspects such as controller, menu, save systems, etc, emerge, these should be transitioned into the _Integration folder following agreement within the Integrations team.

## Repository Maintenance
If unsure of where things should live, if there are **conflicts** in files, if additional files should be put in the .git_ignore, etc, please use the UWEGames Slack to discuss.

**Please contact Carina or Simon for repository management queries.**
