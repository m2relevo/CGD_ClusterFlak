Peter,

Created a scene to try to build iso movement.
(Created in version 5.0.1 (due to 2q24 being on this version). Should be issue free but just keep this in mind)

Folder 1.0 will contain all version 1.0 work. 
At this stage 1.0 will be all tests and prototype work.

IsoMovement 1.0 is attempt at working in iso and moving players.

Player always moving, direction arrows change player direction.

Made script to handle sprites, not very efficient but makes code a bit more human readable / flexible. Simply add the sprites to its sprite array, and then
add their names (in order they are added) to the name list. (example of how to access a script in isomove)...

Set up quick function for handling players bouncing when they hit the edge.

Peter,

Created archive folder in scripts, to put obsolete but potential useful scripts into.
Beginning work on a NEW movement script for VEHICLES

Gareth,

Created Input manager to handle input and output direction to the appeopriate movement classes (to be created)
Skeleton of script, logic is there but needs covertion to actual code
(Initialy dont on 05/02 butlost due to repository issues)

Peter,

Began work on vehicle movement script. 360 degree turning, with 'closest fit' sprites. Currently plain forward movement, hope to have it accelerate / deccelerate.
Also added a 'floor hit box' for the player, to allow us to detect if off the edge (should also work for collisions too ?). Should just destroy player when they leave map. 
(This also uses a custom hitbox for the floor, needs to be updated as the ground is)

Peter,

Bit of a mix in this one, so sit tight.
Firstly, should have 'fixed' the vehicle movement and interactions now. This still uses just the bouncy material, but I should be able to fiddle with custom collision stuff
now.
Also spent a bit of time getting two player movement onto a controller however it doesn't synch up with my xbox controllers so it's a bit funny, but next time we get a chance, would should 
get 2 (atleast) people playing together just to get a feel for how things work when the other players are actually moveing too. 

Finally, I have started on getting a general bit of gameplay in. This so far consits of displaying lives (which should work dynamically as we add players (aslong as it no more than 4))
and falling off the edge now causes players to lose a life, upon losing 3 they are 'out' and become disabled, Currently losing players are just added to a list on screen but hopefully I 
can turn this into a leaderboard when only one player remains at the end.

Peter,

Created a second 'version' 2.0, to make use of 1.0 stuff in a tidier environment. This uses the same background as most of the other teams,so it looks a bit nicer, 
and this should give us some room to get a better feel for everything. 

Set up 2 individual 'player' prefabs so we can more easily test each movement style etc...

Peter,

Firstly, fixed the mumbo jumbo causing the scoring thing to not work in 2.0.

Aside from that I've started working on a custom collision system (because it will look nice and I don't know what else to do :S)
So far this has just been set up to call a function on a collision with some (probably dirty as hell) system to ensure it is only called once per collision
(Obviously with two thingies needed for a collision, it would get called twice for each collision without this). And i've commented out how I expect
each 'type' of collision (head on, from behind and side on) to behave.
Will flesh this out in future updates.

Peter, 

Rearranged file structure to include a General folder (things that aren't version specific)

Started developing a rounds system, rather than the lives system in 2.0. This is sort of functioning, but needs to be FIXED because it's got some issues with
detecting what to do when.
